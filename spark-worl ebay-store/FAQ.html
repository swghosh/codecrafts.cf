<p><b>When can I expect new product(s) to be listed on your store?</b><br/>

<p><b>How can I provide feedback about a product?</b><br/>
We look forward to hearing feedback about our product(s). You can find section specifically designed for reviews on each product page.</p>

<p><b>Is there somewhere I can go to view the product live prior to purchasing?</b><br/>
Unfortunately, we do not have a retail store and, for safety reasons, we cannot allow customers in our warehouse. If you have any questions regarding the product(s), please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

<p><b>I am bidding many items. Can I wait for payment till the auctions on all items end?</b><br/>
No Problem. You can bid and buy as many items as you wish from our store. You can pay later altogether with combined shipping rates when you finish buying. Just request us for an invoice when you are finished with shopping. In the meantime, if you receive invoice from us, just ignore it.</p>

<p><b>Is this item brand new?</b><br/>
All of the items we sell are brand new. We do not sell "factory seconds", "B-Stock" "replicas" or "second quality" items. If the item says "New" under item condition then that means it is a brand new item exactly like the one you would find in your local retail store, the only difference is that our price is much lower as we are manufacturers ourselves.</p>

<p><b>Is a signature required upon delivery?</b><br/>
In most cases a signature in person is required for delivery. If you will not be home during the day to sign for the package, please have the item shipped to your work address instead.

<h2>WHAT IS MY BANGLE SIZE?</h2>


<p>Bangles are sized by their diameter, which is a measure of the length of a straight line passing through the center of the bangle, terminated at both ends on the periphery (circumference) of the bangle. The unit of measurement is inches.
An inch is further divided into 16 sections. So, when we say the bangle size is 2-8 (pronounced two eight), it means the diameter of the bangle is 2 full inches plus 8 sections of the total 16 sections of the inch. This effectively converts to 2 inches + 8/16 inches, which is 2 inches plus half an inch. In other words this size will be 2.5" (pronounced two point five inches)</p>

<p><b>Measure Good Fitting Bangles that You Already Own</b><br/>
Take out bangles that you already have and measure the inside diameter and compare to the below measurement chart or the measurement stated in the actual bangle listing.
As long as you measure the inside diameter of your current bangles this will be an accurate way to find your bangle size.</p>
